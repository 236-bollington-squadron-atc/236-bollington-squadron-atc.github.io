## Are you up for fun, adventure, incredible experiences and making new friends? Are you looking for something to give you the edge in life?  Then welcome to the Royal Air Force Air Cadets.

Better known as the "Air Cadets", we’re a UK-wide cadet force with more than 50,000 members aged between 12 and 20 years.

We’re sponsored by the Royal Air Force and can give you hands-on experience of activities and courses that will challenge and develop your skills to help you succeed in whatever you want to do.

Our aims are to:

* Promote and encourage a practical interest in aviation and the Royal Air Force among young people
* Provide training which will be useful in the Services and civilian life
* Encourage the spirit of adventure and develop qualities of leadership  and good citizenship
