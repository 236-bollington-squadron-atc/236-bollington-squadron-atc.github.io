## If you're a fan of aviation, action and adventure, love sports and getting to know people, then you're in the right place!

236 Bollington Squadron parades every Monday and Thursday nights at 7pm at The Slaughter House, Shrigley Road, Bollington.

If you are interested in joining why not come along and meet the cadets and staff? We can guarantee a warm welcome to all new cadets. Every year nearly 60,000 air cadets and volunteer staff take part in exciting events all over the country. And with over 1,000 squadrons across the UK, you could be one of them.

## Ready for a challenge?

As a cadet you'll have the opportunity to do things that others only dream about. Want real flight experience? No problem. How about heading out on adventurous training and camps, sometimes overseas? Normal for cadets. Competitive sports, drill, shooting, music, abseiling, engineering projects?

Our list of activities is long, varied and open to all cadets. Yes it's a challenge, but that's what life's all about. Let's face it - where else would you be given the opportunity to fly solo in a glider or powered aircraft when you're 17? Whatever you do with your life, at the end of your time as a cadet you'll be self-motivated, confident and ready for anything.
