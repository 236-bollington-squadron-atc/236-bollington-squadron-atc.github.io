## Did you know that whenever you buy anything online - from your weekly shop to your annual holiday - you could be collecting free donations for 236 (Bollington) Squadron air cadets?

Last year our supporters raised £270 for the Squadron simply by signing up to Easyfundraising and nominating the Squadron as their worthy cause for each donation received.
 
There are over 3,000 shops and sites on board ready to make a donation, including Amazon, John Lewis, Aviva, thetrainline and Sainsbury's – it doesn't cost you a penny extra!
 
### It's as easy as 1, 2, 3...
 
1. Head to [https://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/causes/236sqn/](https://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/causes/236sqn/) and join for free.
 
2. Every time you shop online, go to easyfundraising first to find the site you want and start shopping.
 
3. After you’ve checked out, that retailer will make a donation to the Squadron for no extra cost whatsoever!
 
There are no catches or hidden charges and 236 (Bollington) Squadron will be really grateful for your donations.  Every penny really does count!
 
Thank you for your support.
