## Over 20? Seeking a new challenge? Would you like to develop skills, leadership qualities and gain qualifications too?

At Air Cadets, we constantly assess our past achievements, implement changes to meet the challenges of today and make plans for the future. And a huge part of that planning is you. As the backbone of our organisation we’re always on the look out for high-calibre individuals to become volunteers, helping to run the activities that play such an important role in the lives of our young members.

All kinds of people make up our volunteer staff, coming from a range of backgrounds and interests. Obviously if you have direct experience of working with young people, or any relevant skills such as flying or gliding, you would be particularly welcome. These aren’t essential though, as we will train and support you at every stage.

That said, you’ll have some personal qualities that are essential, such as patience, maturity and responsibility along with an understanding of young people and their needs. You needn’t be an athlete, but a good level of physical fitness also helps to ensure you can keep up with the cadets!

### Are you Officer or SNCO material?
We rely on our volunteers to help us operate as effectively as possible. Being well organised is an obvious must, ideally with good managerial and administrative skills, and an ability to listen to problems and deal with them tactfully and appropriately.

Really show your skills in these areas and you could end up taking on more responsibility and moving up through the ranks as an officer or senior non-commissioned officer (SNCO). Of course, first you have to join as a Civilian Instructor and then have selection interviews at Wing HQs and Regional HQs but we guide you through that… if you have the potential then we’ll spot it!
